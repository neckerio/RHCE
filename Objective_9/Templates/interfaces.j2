{% for intf in interfaces -%}
interface {{ intf }}
 description {{ interfaces[intf].description }}
 ip address {{ interfaces[intf].ipv4_address }}
{% endfor %}


## NOTE!, interfaces[intf] needs to be used to access the attributes of each	interfaces, the interfaces have been labeled as "intf" in the for loop

## NOTE!, both key:value can be retrieved using this notation, output is the same, this makes it easier to access attributes, especially deeply nested things, apparently.

#		{% for iname, idata in interfaces.items() -%}
#		interface {{ iname }}
#		description {{ idata.description }}
#		ip address {{ idata.ipv4_address }}
#		{% endfor %}
