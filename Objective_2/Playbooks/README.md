# Playbooks

> Playbooks record and execute Ansibleâ€™s configuration, deployment, and orchestration functions. They can describe a policy you want your remote systems to enforce, or a set of steps in a general IT process. [^playbooks]

	* **autocmd** - work on opening file 
	* **FileType** - work on these types of files
	* **setlocal** - set only local to current buffer or window
	* **ai** - autoindent
	* **ts** - number of spaces that a tab in the file counts for
	* **sw** - affects how autoindentation works (<< >> == as well)
	* **et** - ensures that tab will actually use spaces

## Notes
1. Handlers are the same level as **name:**, **hosts:** and **tasks:** (play definition)
2. ***remote_user***, **become:**, ***become_method*** and ***become_user*** can also be defined at the Play Definition.
3. Start with --- and end with ...
4. Importing incorporates playbooks etc. statically; they are executed in order just as if they had been defined in the playbook [^importing]
5. Include, adds playbooks etc. dynamically; so they can be affected by results of earlier tasks in the playbook. Useful when looping, the tasks will be executed once for each loop. [^including]
